## This world is a sandbox... and you are the child. Pull the strings of heroes and villains. And most importantly...
# Happy Hunting...

Happy Hunting is a Tower Defense game project made for the first semester of the second year Software Development Course of the Mediacollege Amsterdam. In this game you'll buy and place turret towers that will attack waves of enemies. But the waves become longer and the enemies become stronger. So you've got to buy more from the money you gained from killing enemies. Along with new gameplay mechanics that takes a new spin on the Tower Defense genre, this will be a game worth playing!
